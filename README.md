# Game-Of-Life
A C++ implementation of Conway‚Äôs Game of Life, developed as part of my Programming Fundamentals semester project. This simulation explores the evolution of cellular automata while demonstrating concepts in algorithm design, grid-based logic, and terminal-based visualization.

üìå Features
Terminal-based grid visualization

User-defined initial live cells

Custom number of generations

Automatic update of grid across generations

Live and dead neighbor counting

Dynamic cell evolution based on classic rules

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works
You input:

The number of generations to simulate

The number of live cells to start with

The coordinates of each live cell

The program then:

Simulates the game over your specified generations

Applies rules to determine cell survival, death, or birth

Prints the updated grid for each generation

‚öôÔ∏è Rules Implemented
The game follows Conway's rules:

If the cell is dead:
Rule: 1
Birth: if exactly three of its neighbors are alive, the cell will become alive at the next step.

If the cell is already alive:
Rule: 2
Survival: if the cell has two or three live neighbors, the cell remains alive.

Otherwise, the cell will die:
Rule: 3
Death by loneliness: if the cell has only zero or one alive neighbor, the cell will become dead at
the next step.

Rule:4
Death by overcrowding: if the cell is alive and has more than three alive neighbors, the cell also
dies.


üíª Technologies Used
C++

File I/O (fstream)

2D arrays

Basic terminal output

(Optional) system("clear") for refreshing the screen between generations

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
Compile the code:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -o gameoflife main.cpp
Run the executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
./gameoflife
Follow the prompts to enter:

Number of generations

Number of starting cells

Coordinates for each cell
